    """Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation algorithm (also known as
    Parzen-Rosenblatt Window algorithm).

    This algorithm employs a non-parametric method to estimate the probability
    density of a multivariate random variable. The general idea is to
    approximate the density by interpolation over a small fixed size (bandwidth)
    window using a finite number of reference samples. The interpolation is
    controlled by a special function called kernel, which must be >= 0 and
    integrate to one over the domain.

    For more information about this algorithm, see [Duda2000]_.

    *PS: This implementation uses an isotropic bandwidth matrix.*

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1D-array
        The test sample. This must be a vector with the same dimensionality of
        the reference samples.
    data : 2D-array
        The reference samples. This must be a MxN matrix formed by M
        observations of N features.
    h : float
        The size of the window (bandwidth). Must be > 0.
    kernel : function, optional
        The interpolation kernel. It's normal by default.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        Estimated density evaluated at the test sample.

    This algorithm generates a Bayesian classifier by approximating p(x|class)
    using Kernel Density Estimation.

    For more information about Kernel Density Estimation and Bayesian
    classification, see [Duda2000]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 2D-array
        The training data. This must be a MxN matrix formed by M observations of
        N features.
    labels : 1D-array
        The training labels. This must be an array the same size as the training
        data rows.
    h : float
        The size of the window (bandwidth). Must be > 0.
    kernel : function, optional
        The interpolation kernel. It's normal by default.
    priors : 1D-array, optional
        Priors estimatives for each class. This must be an array the same size
        as unique(labels) and sum to one (tolerance of 1e-5). It's calculated
        from the data by default.

    Returns
    -------
    classifier : function
        The classifier function. This is a function f : V -> L where V is the
        feature space and L is the class space.
    discriminants : 1D-array of functions
        A list of the Bayesian discriminants (non-normalized posteriors) for
        each class. The Bayesian discriminant for the c class is a function
        g_c(x)=p(x|c)*p(c). So, it's possible to get the posterior by
        p(c|x)=g_c(x)/(sum_c(g_c(x)).
    priors : 1D-array
        The echo of the priors if informed or a list of estimated values from
        the data.
