ml - Machine Learning in Python
-------------------------------

This is a personal project whose goal is to concentrate all my Python code
about Machine Learning.

You are completely free to use it anyway you want. However, it'd be cool
if I was notified... just to know that this is useful for someone else =).

Of course, use it without any warranty... at your own risk. I can't guarantee
complete documentation and stability. I make it stable and documented just
enough for my own purposes.

Also, any contribution (new algorithms and, particularly, tests) are welcome.
Send me a pull request or a patch and i'll be very happy to review it.



Currently, the following features are implemented:

- Supervised Learning:

    * Bayesian classifier based on Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
    * Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation
    * Bayesian classifier based on Kernel Density Estimation
    * kNN and Weighted-kNN classifiers
    * Rules for combination of classifiers (sum, product, median,
      min, max, majority) with single/multiple feature spaces
    * Stratified k-Fold cross validation
    * Some convenient functions to help evaluation

- Unsupervised Learning:

    * Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) realization of the k-Medoids
      class of clustering algorithms
    * Some convenient functions to help partition clustering evaluation

- Statistics:

    * Efficient mode and frequency count functions
    * Multivariate normal PDFs

Dependencies
